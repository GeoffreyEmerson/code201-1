          <h2>Master of Woo: Pep&eacute; Le Pew</h2>
          <img src="pepelepew_standing.png" alt="" />
          <p>Pep&eacute; Le Pew, who burst on the scene in France in 1945, is the walking embodiment of old school charm. This devilishly handsome woo'er is admired for his unbridled confidence and eternal optimism. Pep&eacute; knows that the answer to "What should I wear?" is the always a classicly minimalist black-and-white. He complements his roguish smile with perfectly coiffed hair. (Pro tip: Gel is key to that perfect <em>swoosh</em>!) He takes full advantage of his alluring foreign accent, at once thrilling and musical to the untrained ear. Yet Pep&eacute; knows, as do all woo'ers, that the thrill of the foreign must be tempered with the familiar, hence his adoption of the English spelling of his name.</p>

          <h4>DID YOU KNOW?</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Pepé's reluctant significant other is Penelope Pussycat, a black cat who has had a white stripe painted down her back by accident. (It's always best to heed "Wet Paint" signs!)</li>
            <li><i>L'amour</i> is about more than meets the eye. When Pepé realizes that Penelope is in fact a cat, he covers his white stripe with black paint, taking the appearance of a cat before resuming the chase. Such <i>solidarité</i>!</li>
            <li>Pepé's known aliases include the much less imaginative "Henry" and "Stinky".</li>
            <li>In the 1990's, Pepé made several cameo appearances in the <i>Tiny Toon Adventures</i> series as a professor at Acme Looniversity and mentor to fellow skunk, Fifi La Fume.</li>
            <li>When dubbed in French, Pepé Le Pew became <i>Pepé le putois</i> and spoke with an italian accent, because when it comes to the Art of Woo, Italians are second only to the French!</li>
